# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## What is done
* Display current date and time on the top of calendar
* Time blocks for standard business hours presented when scrolling
* Each time blocks are coded to indicate whether in the past (light shell), future(purple) or present(bisque)
* The user can enter a event when clicking into the timeblocks
* The event is saved to local storage when clicking the save button
* When refreshing the page, the saved events persist
* Add sticky footer

## What needs to be done
* Add a clear button

## User Story
